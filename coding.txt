.
Keywords
200
This access modifier allows a member to be seen from anywhere
public
400
This token marks a field as constant or a method as non-overrideable
final
600
This keyword invokes a member of the base class
super
800
This keyword prevents exceptions from halting execution
catch
1000
This keyword halts execution
break
.
Threading
200
Calling this method creates a new thread
start
400
A custom thread class can be created by extending thread or implementing this
Runnable
600
The problem of managing threads' access to shared resources is known as this
Concurrency
800
Java simply handles multithreading with this keyword
