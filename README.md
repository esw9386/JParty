# JParty

### Template Formatting
JParty accepts .txt files as game templates. To make your own JParty game, download the [blank template](template.txt) and replace the categories, clues, and answers with your own. The clue values can be changed as well, but this is not recommended. Any template to be used with JParty must be formatted correctly as indicated by the blank template.
