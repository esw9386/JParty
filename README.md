# JParty
This is JParty!

### Gameplay
JParty can only be played with three teams—no more, no less. When playing JParty, the host is responsible for editing team scores. This is done by typing a team's updated score into the view under the game board.

### Template Formatting
JParty accepts .txt files as game templates. To make your own JParty game, download the [blank template](template.txt) and replace the categories, clues, and answers with your own. The [filled preset](coding.txt) is also available for download. Clue values can be changed as well, but this is not recommended, especially since the host directly manipulates team scores. When editing a template, only edit within a line—the formatting is delimited by newlines and punctuation.

We hope you enjoy playing JParty
