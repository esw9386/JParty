# JParty

### Template Formatting
JParty accepts JSON files as game templates. To make your own JParty game, download one of the preset templates shown when choosing a game, and edit the categories and clues. Java doesn't have native support for JSON but a [json-simple
library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads) is downloadable.
